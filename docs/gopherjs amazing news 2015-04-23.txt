Most recent major GopherJS news:

- 29 days ago, the support for blocking calls became default, without needing to mark with `//gopherjs:blocking`. This was the last "not-really-Go" thing you needed to do previously. [0]

- There's a 1.0 milestone now, so Richard is getting closer to a 1.0 release. [1]

- Also recently, added support to make GET, POST requests via "net/http" (in browser) by providing a `net.Transport` implemented on top of XMLHttpRequest. [2]

- There's recent work on a "gopherjs serve" command to make development more convenient. [3]

I'm using GopherJS a lot.

Most recently, I ported google/gxui Go package to run in the browser [4]. You can try it here [5].

I've done some 3D stuff that works both on desktop and in browser by leveraging GopherJS. Here's a mini demo of that [6]. Hold down left mouse button and drag mouse to look around.

Here's a live markdown editor (and formatter) in browser, it uses existing Go packages. [7]

I gave a talk about GopherJS at previous GoSF meetup [8], which included some of these demos, and described the most common questions/concerns (debugging, file size, performance, general experience, advantages and disadvantages).

Previous discussion from 6 months ago [9].
