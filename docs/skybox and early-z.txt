==================
skybox and early-z
==================

Option 1:
If you want your skybox to be always visible at any distance...
Set up a viewport with MinDepth 1 and MaxDepth 1.
Draw it as a 10x10x10 (adjust size to suit your near clipping plane) cube centered on the view origin.
That's really all there is to it.  Do it last after all other opaque objects in your scene, of course,
so that you'll get the benefit of early-Z rejection.
Otherwise this will absolutely guarantee that the skybox will be drawn at the very furthest depth,
no matter what values you pick for zNear and zFar, and you don't need to do anything fancy.
Just the most basic shaders and you get the desired result.

Option 2:
To make it always render to the far-plane, you can also put this at the end of your
vertex shader (instead of your logarithmic z line).
output.Position.z = output.Position.w;
