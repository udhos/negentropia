Super-shaders versus switching multiple programs

"Generally speaking, super-shaders are the wrong way to go, particularly on some hardware. We know of some (now-older) mobile GPUs that indeed have 2^N execution time for N branches in a shader. Newer stuff behaves better, but branches are generally still a big performance hit. Changing programs during rendering is fine."
