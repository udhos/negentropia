TODO

0. remove textureUnit code
   because we don't need to sample multiple textures
   on a single shader pass

1. put a big planet on zone z:0

2. put a terrain vehicle (car) on big planet surface

3. make the terrain vehicle to move on planet surface

4. create gates between zones z:0 and z:1

5. make a control to order a unit to move towards a target

6. make units to cross the zone gates
